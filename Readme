Summary
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

Instructions
To create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

Extract the data from the database using SQL
Open up the CSV in Excel
Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures
Plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable
Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends
Database Schema
There are three tables used:

city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
Submission
Project submission should be a PDF that includes an outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:

What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
How did you calculate the moving average?
What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
Line chart with local and global temperature trends
At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
